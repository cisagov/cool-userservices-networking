# cool-userservices-networking #

[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-userservices-networking/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-userservices-networking/actions)

This is a Terraform deployment for creating the VPC, public subnets,
and private subnets for the COOL User Services account.

Until this project moves to Terraform 0.13, there is [no `depends_on`
support for modules](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17101),
and we have no way to ensure that the `ProvisionNetworking` policy is attached
to the `ProvisionAccount` role before Terraform attempts to instantiate
the subnet modules.  Therefore, in order to apply this Terraform code,
one must run a targeted apply before running a full apply:

```console
terraform apply -var-file=<workspace>.tfvars -target=aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.provisionnetworking_policy_attachment -target=aws_iam_policy.provisionnetworking_policy
```

At this point the `ProvisionNetworking` policy is attached to the
`ProvisionAccount` role and you can run a full `terraform apply`.

## Pre-requisites ##

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your system.
- An accessible AWS S3 bucket to store Terraform state
  (specified in [backend.tf](backend.tf)).
- An accessible AWS DynamoDB database to store the Terraform state lock
  (specified in [backend.tf](backend.tf)).
- Access to all of the Terraform remote states specified in
  [remote_states.tf](remote_states.tf).

## Inputs ##

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |

This list must be the same length as private\_subnet\_cidr\_blocks, since each private subnet will be assigned a NAT gateway in a public subnet in the same Availability Zone. | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| read\_terraform\_state\_role\_name | The name to assign the IAM role (as well as the corresponding policy) that allows read-only access to the cool-userservices-networking state in the S3 bucket where Terraform state is stored. | `string` | `"ReadUserServicesNetworkingTerraformState"` | no |

| vpc | The User Services VPC. |

## Notes ##

Running `pre-commit` requires running `terraform init` in every directory that
contains Terraform code. In this repository, this is just the main directory.
